# Bento Public

A publicly accessible portal for clinical datasets, where users are able to see high-level statistics of the data 
available through predefined variables of interest and search the data using limited variables at a time. This portal 
allows users to gain a generic understanding of the data available (secure and firewalled) without the need to access 
it directly.
